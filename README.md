My name is Abigail and I am an aspiring games developer/software engineer/Computer Science educator. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Lincoln in Computer Science and I have previous education experience through my Games Design diploma in Unity and C#.

My games portfolio is located at [abigailgd.me.uk](https://abigailgd.me.uk) and is frequently updated with new projects that I am working on.
